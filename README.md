## Getting Started

To begin, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Adding a Component

- Locate the "Code" button in the top right corner of the component page.
- Click on it and copy the provided shell command. It will resemble something like this: `npx v0 add componentId.`
- Next, launch your development server, paste the command into the input field, and click on "Add."
